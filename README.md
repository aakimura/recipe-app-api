# Readme
This project comes from the Udemy course [Build a Backend REST API with Python & Django - Advanced](https://www.udemy.com/course/django-python-advanced/).

## Notes
The folder also contains a [Notes](notes.md) file that contains useful tips for building a REST API in Django.

## Technologies used
This course is great because of the technologies that are used to build the API. It includes: Docker, Travis CI and PostgreSQL. It also focuses on Test Driven Development (TDD) which "separates great developers from good developers".
